## Description 
Here I have created an application that gives the user access to find out what dog/dogs are best suited to them. The app entails a sign up page that has multiple questions about your life, living and dog breed/size preference. The user will have a dashboard/profile where all the data of the matched dogs will be stored until next login. 

## Installation Instructions
Simply clone the repository into your directory, then right click and run Open Intergrated Terminal, run ``'npm install'`` to install the required dependencies.


## Usage Information
 * React
 * GraphQl
 * JWT-Decode
